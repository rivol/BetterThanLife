Better Than Life
================

This is a little Oculus Rift game created at IGDA Estonia Game Jam 2014.

You will suddenly find yourself in a western-themed bar. Due to some unfortunate event, you've been tied to a post and an angry-looking guy with a bow is about to send some arrows flying in your direction.
Hopefully you can dodge them...

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Oculus Rift DK2 is required to run the game. Since the game depends on the head-tracking, DK1 will unfortunately not work.

Screenshots
-----------

The bar looks quite inviting at first:

... until that guy starts shooting arrows at you:

some of them are even flaming:

Hopefully none of them scratched you before sticking to the wall behind you:

Technology
----------

The game has been created using Unity and Oculus SDK 0.4.2

It also uses [RiftGesture](https://github.com/KatsuomiK/RiftGesture) for head nod/shake detection in the menus.
